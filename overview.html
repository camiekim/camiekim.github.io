<p>The <strong>Waterloo Cross-Dressing Archive</strong> is part of an ongoing research project on cross-dressing in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature and society
 initiated and directed by Fraser Easton. The WXDA aims to:</p>
 
<ul>
<li><strong>Expand significantly the range of primary documentation for the study of the material practices of gender variant dress, and make this documentation publicly
available,</strong> beginning with the Times of London from its inception in 1785 for a full century, that is until 1884.  (This expansion follows in part on increases in
news production and consumption as the eighteenth century moves into the nineteenth, of which the Times is a leader and bellwether.)</li>

<li><strong>Provide a systematic and comprehensive aggregation of cross-dressing records,</strong> so that the fullest possible record of trends, variation, distribution,
and generic treatments of the social practice may be traced. (Understanding the limits due to contemporary assumptions and biases, the inaccuracies of journalism, and the
arbitrariness of what makes it into the news versus what does not.)</li>

<li><strong>Enrich the significance of individual records by tying them, through a series of metatags, to related records across a long-range series,</strong> initially of the
first century of the Times.  Thus the aggregate records will be searchable for general characteristics such as place or time, but also by factors related to the representation
of the individuals in the reports, as well as the nature of the reporting itself.</li>

<li><strong>Enable the examination of trends in the reporting of cross-dressing activities</strong> in terms of frequency, kind, and rendering across key eras of social and
cultural development, particularly the period between 1770 and 1850.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a research tool, of course, the WXDA seeks to serve the interests of its users, and <strong>we actively encourage you to send us your thoughts about any aspect of this
project,</strong> including but not limited to the affordances of the Heurist database, the analytic fields and values used in the records, and the search function of the web
portal you are currently viewing (as found through the Search tab above). Further development of the WXDA will be shaped in part by the feedback collected from you, its users.</p>

<p>In particular, <strong>the WXDA seeks to be inclusive and nonjudgemental about the myriad implications of the representation of the material practices of gender variant
dress.</strong> The WXDA seeks to present both period records directly and unedited, and to make them available through the metatags to present-day interests, understandings,
and communities. If we can improve our inclusivity or our historical accuracy in any way, please let us know!</p>

<strong>Next steps for the WXDA</strong>

<ul>
<li>To refine and confirm the selection of fields and values for the metatags.</li>
<li>Continue adding records from additional years of the Times, completing the series from 1785 to 1884.</li>
<li>Add records from other sources, initially other periodical records such as the Gentleman's Magazine and the Daily Advertiser, taking the chronological extent of the archive
from the early eighteenth century to the late nineteenth.</li>
</ul>

<tr><td><strong>How this database was developed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The records in the WXDA were located over a period of years using both microfilm copies of the Times and the Times online database.</li>
<li>For the research conducted on the Times online database, a defined search set was developed with which to locate records. The same search set was used for all
searches with the aim of facilitating a consistent and comprehensive capture of cross-dressing records.</li>
<li>Given the vagaries of vocabulary in newspaper reports of gender-variant dress, problems with typographical elements (broken typeface, poor contrast on the original
impression), and the limits of OCR, no keyword-based search set can guarantee a complete recovery of cross-dressing reports in the Times online database.</li>
<li>Happily, a comparison of the Times online database search set results with the results of searches of the Times in microfilm format shows a roughly 95% capture rate
with the use of the search set as compared with the use of microfilm. Comparison of search set results with microfilm results also demonstrates that digital searches
located some records (< 5%) missed in the examination of the microfilm format.</li>
